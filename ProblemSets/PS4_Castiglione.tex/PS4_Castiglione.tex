\section{Interest}
One thing that really comes to mind when it comes to areas that I look forward to web scraping is statistics that involve my thesis. My thesis involves the correlation between strength coach salaries and on field performance of college football teams. Right now I am looking into only using data on one conference. Statistics I would need is win loss, rushing yards per game, and total yards per game. I do think the statistics would be very easy to scrape off once I find and master scraping. I am sure you have many recommendations. 


\section{SparkR Questions}
1. \textbf{What is the class of each?}
    -Data Frame
2. \textbf{SELECT - If you try the previous command on df1, what happens? Why do you think that happened?}
    -They were very similar answers. 
3. \textbf{FILTER - If you again try the previous command on df1, what happens? Why do you think that happened?}
    -they were very similar answers.
