\section{Strength Coaches - USA TODAY SCRAPE}
In my thesis study I am looking for a correlation between strength coaches, and on field performance. So for this assignment I wanted to look at the salaries of all Division 1 strength coaches. Being a news website such as USA Today I was expecting it to be a little easier than it was. After a few Google searches and lots of references in the notes I was able to figure out how to take the name, school and salary of the coaches. I look forward to using some of this data in the future on my thesis and some capacity on the final project. 
\section{Paycom - Yahoo Finance}
I chose to scrape the data of Paycom Software inc, which is an Oklahoma based company.  Quite frankly I own some of their stock so their stock prices are in high interest of mine! Their stock has been on a constant climb but as of recent there has been many spikes. I used the XML package and used Yahoo Finance because I found that their is a corresponding package.
